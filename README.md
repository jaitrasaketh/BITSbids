BITSbids
BITSbids is a web application developed as a CS F213 project, providing a convenient and secure platform for BITS Pilani students to buy and sell used products among themselves. The primary focus is on creating a user-friendly bidding system for items such as electronic gadgets, books, sports equipment, and more. The application is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
1. Product Search
Easily search for products based on various criteria such as category, keywords, or specific attributes.

2. Bidding System
Users can place bids on products until a specified deadline. The bidding process adds an element of excitement to the buying experience.

3. Private Messaging
Enable direct communication between buyers and sellers through a private messaging system integrated into the platform.

4. BITS Email Single Sign-On (SSO)
To ensure a secure and exclusive environment, user accounts are linked to BITS email addresses. Only BITS Pilani students can register, and access is restricted for outsiders.

5. Double Blind Transactions
Maintain user privacy by keeping personal details, including names, hidden from both the buyer and seller until the bidding process is completed.

6. Comprehensive Product Listings
Each product listing includes detailed information such as pictures, possible short video clips, descriptions, and asking prices.

7. Dual Role for Users
Every user on BITSbids is both a buyer and a seller, promoting a dynamic and engaging marketplace experience.
