# BITSbids
CS F213 Project.
A webapp that can run on desktop and mobiles, to make a bidding platform for selling used products (electronic gadgets, books, sports item etc.) from students to students. The salient features includes: 
Product search (better if contextual)
Bidding on a product till a deadline 
Private messaging with seller. 
Every account is through BITS email SSO and outsiders are not allowed. 
For bidding , a virtual currency.

Product listing  contains pictures (and possible short video clips also), description, and asking price. 
The seller and buyer are in double blind (no one  should see the personal details or even name of the other one) till the bid is frozen. 

Everyone is both a buyer and a seller.
